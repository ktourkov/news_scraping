      "2022-09-15T13:14:00-04:00 These 20 stocks have short interest of 19% or more, and AMC and GameStop are not even in the top half \n",
      " Short selling is a trading technique that gets especially popular during bear markets in stocks.Short selling — or betting on a decline in prices — can come to the fore if investors suspect a company is entering a difficult period, during a period of stress on financial markets, or when a group of traders acts to bid up the shares of companies that professional investors have bet against.It is a very risky technique, as the losses are theoretically infinite, but it is also something every investor should at least understand.Traditionally, short sellers have served a useful role, as they have pointed out problems with companies’ business models, with their industries or even with the way they prepare financial statements. But shorting can also lead to furious trading activity that can burn investors quickly.Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.89% is now the most heavily shorted stock in terms of dollars committed to bets against the company’s stock price. Tesla Inc. TSLA, +0.38% had previously been in that position.But in terms of short positions relative to the number of shares outstanding, Apple’s is only 0.70% sold-short, while 2.32% of Tesla’s share are shorted, according to the most recent data available from FactSet.There are different ways of looking at short exposure, and a list of the most heavily shorted stocks among companies of the Russell 1000 Index RUI, -1.09% , by percentage, is below.Before digging into the short-selling data, let’s review some terms:Short selling is when an investor borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.Covering is when a person with a short position buys the shares to return them to the lender, to profit if the shares have gone down in price since they were shorted, or to limit losses if they went up after being shorted.A short squeeze is when a mass of investors looking to cover short positions start buying at the same time. The buying pushes the share price higher, making short investors accelerate their attempts to cover, which sends the shares spiraling higher in a frenzy. This is what happened earlier this year when a group of traders, who had organized themselves through the Reddit WallStreetBets channel, famously pushed the share prices of two troubled businesses sky-high: GameStop Corp. GME, +1.71% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, -0.30% .Short selling is best left to professional investors and traders because you cannot set an upper limit on how much you might lose if the shares rise in price after you short them — you never know how high a stock price might go. If you buy a stock (take a “long” position), what you have risked is the amount of money you invested. You can lose it all if company goes bankrupt, for example.But to short a stock you need a margin account, which means your broker extends credit if the stock goes up in price after you short it. At a certain point, if the stock continues to rise, your broker will demand collateral to protect its position. This means you will be more likely to be forced to cover the short trade and take a loss.Borrowing shares to short them also costs money — more about that below.Most heavily shorted stocksThe Russell 1000 Index is made up of the 1,000 largest companies in the Russell 3000 Index RUA, -1.07% , which is designed to represent 98% of publicly traded companies whose primary stock listings are in the U.S.Here are the 20 companies in the Russell 1000 that are most heavily shorted on a percentage basis, according to the most recent data available from FactSet:Click on the tickers for more about each company. Click here for Tomi Kilgore’s detailed guide to the wealth of information available for free on MarketWatch quote pages.The best-performing stock on the list this year has been Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, -1.34% , whose presence on the list may be a surprise.The company’s rolling 12-month estimates for earnings and sales have been increasing and, on a calendar-year basis, the consensus expectation among analysts polled by FactSet is for its revenue to increase 28% in 2022.From 2022 through 2024, analysts expect to see a compound annual growth rate of 21.6% for Palo Alto’s sales. Maybe it is the high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55.2 that has spooked investors. After all, the weighted forward P/E for the S&P 500 information technology sector has fallen to 20.5 from 28.1 at the end of 2021, according to FactSet. For the full S&P 500 SPX, -1.13% , the forward P/E has declined to 16.7 from 21.4 at the end of last year.(Companies with “N/A” in the P/E ratio column are those not expected to generate profits over the next 12 months.)The table includes “days to cover,” which is the number of days it would take for short sellers to cover their positions, based on three-month average daily trading volumes. When considering which stocks might be candidates for short squeezes, Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., said in a previous interview that he begins with “a 10/10 rule.” That stands for short interest of at least 10% and at least 10 days needed for short sellers to cover their positions.Brad Lamensdorf, who co-manages the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF HDGE, +1.05% , pointed to other costs that short sellers face. During an interview on Sept. 15, Lamensdorf said that an investor who wishes to short Apple’s shares pays only a nominal “general collateral” fee to borrow the shares. In addition, the borrower of the shares will have to pay Apple’s dividend to the investor who lends the shares. Apple’s dividend yield is 0.59% — “not much, but there is a carry,” Lamensdorf said.But he listed high annualized fees for borrowing shares of some of the heavily short stocks listed above:For AMC, it costs 16.73% to borrow the shares.For GME, the cost is lower: 7.88%.It costs about 2% to borrow shares of Carvana Co. CVNA, +2.63% to short.to short. For Palo Alto and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. DKS, -0.30% , shares can be borrowed as “general collateral.”The AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF is designed to be a hedging tool, and has performed quite well this year, returning 12% through Sept. 14, while the S&P 500 has declined 16% (with dividends reinvested). You can read more about Lamensdorf’s shorting strategy here.Lamensdorf previously warned that a percentage of short-sales to total shares available for trading of “over 30% to 40% is outrageously high,” as it makes short-squeezes more likely.Don’t miss: It’s a great time to scoop up bargain stocks.

      "2022-09-15T18:18:00-04:00 Apple is now the market's most-shorted stock. If Tesla is an example, that's bullish. \n",
      " Apple shareholders need not worry that it’s the most-shorted U.S. stock. I’m referring to the report from short-seller analytics firm S3 Partners that, after 864 days in which Tesla TSLA, +0.38% was at the top of this list, Apple AAPL, -1.89% has acquired this dubious honor. As of Sept. 14, a total of $18.4 billion worth of Apple shares were sold short, eclipsing Tesla’s total of $17.4 billion. That certainly seems like a lot of money aggressively betting that Apple’s stock will fall.Perhaps the first clue that Apple investors nevertheless need not worry comes from Tesla’s market-beating performance even though it topped the most-shorted list. Since April 2020 through Sept. 14, the stock produced a total return of more than 100% annualized, according to FactSet, versus 15% for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.13% . Apple investors can only hope they outperform the market by as much during the time the company is the most-shorted.Tesla is just one data point, of course. The better reason for Apple investors not to worry is that the sheer dollar amount of shares sold short is “pretty meaningless,” Jay Ritter told me in an email. Ritter is a finance professor at the University of Florida and co-author of one of the more cited academic studies on the investment implications of short interest. He added that he is not currently short Apple but is short Tesla.In order for the short-interest data to be meaningful, it must be put in context. A large dollar amount of Apple shares may be sold short, but the company also has the largest market cap of any publicly traded company in the world. Among the more relevant short-selling metrics are the short-interest percentage (the number of shares sold short expressed as a percentage of the total number of shares outstanding) and the days-to-cover ratio (the number of shares sold short divided by average recent daily trading volume).According to either of these two ratios, Apple is actually one of the least-shorted stocks. According to FactSet, in terms of the short-interest ratio Apple ranks in 477th place among the 500 stocks within the S&P 500. In terms of the days-to-cover ratio, it ranks in 463rd place. In other words, what the headlines trumpeted as one thing is in fact precisely the opposite.Might heavy shorting be bullish?Some contrarians may be disappointed to learn that Apple’s short-interest rank is so low. That’s because they believe that high levels of shorting are actually bullish.The problem with this contrarian argument is that it’s wrong, according to Adam Reed, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina who is one of academia’s leading experts on the significance of the short-sale data. In an email, he told me that the strong consensus conclusion of numerous academic studies is that stocks proceed, on average, to underperform the market if they have high short-interest ratios.He added that he is not aware of any academic research that has found the sheer dollar value of shares sold short to be correlated in any meaningful way with a stock’s subsequent performance.The bottom line? Apple’s newly-attained first-place ranking in the most-shorted list is a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

      "2022-09-15T10:05:00-04:00 Tesla has one less bear after Needham upgrades, citing several reasons to expect a stock rally \n",
      " Shares of Tesla Inc. gained Thursday, after Needham backed away from its bearish view on the electric vehicle giant, saying there are now several potential catalysts that could boost the price, and none that might knock it down near term.Needham said it transferred analyst coverage of Tesla, from Raji Gill to Vikram Bagri, and Bagri subsequently raised the rating to hold from underperform.“We believe the stock is fairly priced, and we do not see a catalyst for underperformance in the near-term,” Bagri wrote in a note to clients, with “Catch me if you can” in the title. “In fact, we see several potential catalysts that could drive the stock higher.”Tesla’s stock TSLA, +0.38% climbed 1.0% in afternoon trading toward a one-month high. It has run up 13.1% amid an eight-day stretch in which in has gained seven days.Here are Bagri’s potential positive stock catalysts:Renewal of federal tax credit eligibility, under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax rebates for buying new and used electric vehicles.A potential upgrade of Tesla’s credit rating to investment grade status by the end of the year. S&P Global Ratings currently rates Tesla credit at BB+, which is the highest speculative grade, or “junk” rating, and just one notch below investment grade.The first deliveries of the Cybertruck in 2023.Expansion of the EV charging network and improved utilization.Gross margin improvement, driven by 4680 cells.Bagri said he believes Tesla could achieve about 10% global market share of passenger vehicles, as global battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption is expected to reach 40% by the end of 2023. His market share estimate assumes the company can maintain a market share in China in the “high-single digit” percentage range.Of the 42 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover Tesla, only four are now bearish after Needham’s upgrade, while 27 are bullish and 11 are neutral.The upgrade comes after a report showing that after more than two years, Tesla no longer holds the title of the most bearish bets on the stock. Short interest in Tesla was $17.4 billion as of Wednesday, according to S3 Partners, while Apple Inc.’s stock AAPL, -1.89% became the most shorted with short interest of $18.4 billion.Don’t miss: Tesla spent 864 days as Wall Street’s biggest short bet. Now it’sApple.Separately, Tesla was hit with a new lawsuit, that alleges the EV maker “deceptively and misleadingly” overstated the abilities of its Autopilot and Full Self Driving features.\n",

      "2022-09-15T15:26:00-04:00 Controversial attempt to protect kids online is signed into law by California governor \n",
      " A California bill that could establish a national baseline for protecting children’s personal information and activity online was signed into law by state Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday.The California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, modeled after U.K.’s Age Appropriate Design Code, requires digital platforms such as Meta Platforms Inc.’s META, -1.27% Facebook and Instagram, Snap Inc.’s SNAP, +3.30% Snapchat and TikTok to vet whether new products pose harm to kids and teens before rolling them out. The first law of its kind in the U.S. would also force those companies to offer privacy guardrails to younger users by default.The sweeping children’s online safety measure, passed by the California Legislature Tuesday, rested on the pen of Newsom, a Democrat who hadn’t indicated whether he would sign or veto the bill. Its passage is likely to intensify pressure on Congress to give priority to expanding protections for children. If passed, the bill would become law on July 1, 2024.In-depth: U.S. laws protecting kids online languish behind Europe“We have an opportunity in California to lead the way in making the digital world safer for all American children, giving them the highest level of protection possible in the online world,” state Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, D-Oakland, the bill’s primary author, said in a statement to MarketWatch.Advocates of the kids online bill insist it will have as profound an impact on consumers as California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a privacy-rights law for consumers, and its amended sequel, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).“This is a landmark step toward protecting California kids online. We want it to have the same impact as CCPA,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer, whose advocacy group backed both measures.“It changes the ground rules for technology companies yet again, adding a new layer of privacy legislation for companies whose online products or services are likely to be accessed by minors under the age of 18,” data-privacy attorney Christine Lyon, told MarketWatch. “This law will reach many companies that are not subject to our federal data privacy law, [the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998], which applies only to children under the age of 13.”But critics argue the bill would require mandatory age authentication and change how everyone uses the Internet, according to Eric Goldman, who has written extensively on the topic and serves as co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University Law School.For more: Regulating Big Tech will be hard, and California is proving it“The bill would radically reshape the Internet, requiring businesses to authenticate all of their users’ ages — and that is bad news for everyone,” Goldman told MarketWatch. “Users will first be required to prove their age before they can visit any new site — even if they just plan to visit for a second, and even if they never plan to return. More importantly, the authentication process is highly invasive.”Goldman disputed the comparison to the CCPA, which he dismissed as a toothless law. “Though [CCPA] has been in effect for a few years, can anyone show me a material benefit to consumers, the public or anyone else?” he asked.Trade groups representing the likes of Meta and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.57% have lobbied against the bill, claiming it would blunt innovation, violate constitutional protections for free speech, and would be overly burdensome and invasive for users.“It’s another example of why we need a federal privacy law that includes universal standards to protect kids online instead of a patchwork of state laws that creates confusion and compliance complications for businesses,” says Dylan Hoffman, California executive director for TechNet, whose members include Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -1.99% GOOG, -1.86% Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.77% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.89% , eBay Inc. EBAY, +0.21% , Meta and Snap.See also: Biden finalized his plan to rein in Big Tech. Big Tech wasn’t invited.Meta has taken steps to lower the heat. In August, it announced updates to the blog post it published earlier this summer that makes it harder for young people to come across potentially harmful or sensitive content or accounts in Search, Explore, Hashtag Pages, Reels, Feed Recommendations and Suggested Accounts.Additionally, Meta says teens younger than 16 (or 18 in certain countries) are defaulted into private accounts and other private settings. Across Instagram, Facebook and Messenger, the company says it only allows advertisers to target ads to people under 18.Snap had no comment. Twitter did not respond to email seeking comment.\n",

      "2022-09-16T03:00:00-04:00 3 Chip Stocks That Could Be Takeover Targets: Analyst \n",
      " Some semiconductor stocks are getting cheap enough they might become attractive takeover targets, according to Susquehanna.It has been a rough year for chip stocks. The iShares Semiconductor (SOXX) exchange-traded fund, which tracks the performance of the ICE Semiconductor Index, is down 34% this year as demand for computers and mobile phones has faltered.But according to Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland lower valuations could enable larger companies to scoop up small players and boost their earnings.Our “Accretion Index provides a qualitative framework to evaluate higher-likelihood M&A targets,” he wrote in a note on Thursday. “Using our latest index, we rank our top takeout candidates under coverage: #1) Knowles (ticker: KN ); #2) Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ); and #3) Qorvo ( QRVO ).”Knowles, Cirrus Logic, and Qorvo didn’t respond to requests for comment on the analyst report.On Thursday, Knowles shares were down 0.9% to $13.66; Cirrus Logic stock was down 0.1% to $73.89, and Qorvo stock was up 0.2% to $86.10.For Knowles, Rolland thinks private equity may be interested in its audio and microphone businesses. Cirrus Logic could be attractive to Apple if it wanted to bring more iPhone chips in-house, according to the analyst. Apple couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.And finally Qorvo’s wireless chip business may offer large financial synergies and cost cutting potential for a competing chip maker, Rolland says.The analyst said the industry has consolidated by 10% to 15% on average a year over the last decade, but it had slowed to just 9% in 2021 and 4% this year. He said “stretched valuations” likely were an impediment to mergers and acquisitions.Rolland also noted when his firm highlighted acquisition candidates in 2018, three of four picks were later acquired.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com\n",

      "2022-09-15T14:20:00-04:00 Apple iPhone 14 Goes on Sale Friday. Why You Shouldn't Sell the Stock. \n",
      " Apple users are getting ready for Sept. 16, when the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 plus get released to the public. And while shoppers buy, shareholders should get ready for a boost.Apple (ticker: AAPL) unveiled a new line of products earlier this month, including the newest model of the iPhone. The iPhone 14 is available in a larger size than other iPhone models, has supposedly the best battery life of prior iPhones, and an improved camera. Notably, pricing for the iPhone 14 starts at $799 while the iPhone 14 plus starts at $899, which hasn’t increased from the price of the iPhone 13 in U.S. markets.So what does the release of a new iPhone have to do with the company’s stock?Historically, Apple’s stock price doesn’t do much on an iPhone-release day, gaining less than 1%. However, going all of the way back to the release of the first iPhone, Apple’s stock price has gained on average 1.6% one month after the release of the new iPhone, and that number continued to climb, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock climbed 3.5% on average in the three months after the iPhone releases, and rose 14% six months after the releases.Phone sales are important to Apple. In its latest quarter, Apple reported iPhone sales of $40.7 billion, which was almost half of the total quarterly revenue of $83 billion for the company.And users are eager to get their hands on the phone. Despite ongoing macroeconomic issues such as record-high inflation, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent research note that “the initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units out of the gates with Asian suppliers has stayed firm based on our recent checks and will be roughly flat with iPhone 13 despite the macro storm clouds building.”“This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over three and a half years,” Ives added.Apple stock could use a boost. Shares have struggled after key inflation data showed prices are still too high for the Federal Reserve’s liking. Shares have fallen 13% so far this year, and are down 0.9% Thursday while the S&P 500 was 0.2% in the red.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com\n",

      "2022-09-14T12:51:00-04:00 This is how retail investors responded to this week's dramatic stock-market selloff. (Clue: They can be a very 'contrarian' bunch.) \n",
      " When others were looking for the exits during this week’s selloff, many retail investors saw an entrance to more future gains — but what were they stepping into?Everyday investors bought up $2 billion in equities and ETFs on Tuesday as stock markets slipped badly on hotter-than-hoped August inflation numbers, according to Vanda Research. (Stocks were also down again on Wednesday.)It was 2022’s second largest day of retail purchases into stocks, researchers said in a Wednesday note. A lot of the dip buying occurred in the afternoon and closing 10 minutes, they added.When the dust settled Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.56% had dropped nearly 1,300 points, or 3.9%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.13% shed 4.3% in value and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.43% dropped by 5.2% as investors mulled the possibility of stubbornly high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes to counter the rising price problem. It amounted to the worst daily loss since June 2020.Tuesday’s buying spree was second to the $2.6 billion spent on May 5, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average sloughed off more than 1,000 points, Vanda Research said. On that day, many investors turned panicky after a rally the day before during a freshly-announced Federal Reserve interest rate hike.Seeing a pattern? So are the analysts at Vanda Research.“At the cost of sounding like a broken record, we like to remind our readers that retail investors are generally a contrarian bunch — they buy the dip on down days and scale back their purchases (or outright sell) on up days,” they wrote in Wednesday’s note.A lot of Tuesday’s buying focused on exchange traded funds such as Invesco’s QQQ QQQ, -1.67% , tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, -1.14% , which follows the S&P 500 benchmark, researchers said. The stock-picking purchases centered on big names including Apple AAPL, -1.89% and Tesla TSLA, +0.38% , they noted.Related: Hear from Carl Icahn at the Best New Ideas in Money Festival on Sept. 21 and Sept. 22 in New York. The legendary trader will reveal his view on this year’s wild market ride.Companies like Apple and Tesla already loom large in retail investor portfolios. On Friday, a new index from Robinhood HOOD, +4.36% , the brokerage app popular with many new investors, said those companies are among the 10 most-held stocks within its users’ accounts.(People who like going against the grain might also want to look at companies in sectors like online advertising, according to MarketWatch’s Philip van Doorn.)Despite Tuesday’s spending spike, retail investor buying demand has been weakening, Vanda Research noted. That’s partly a seasonal trend when holiday spending starts to compete for investors’ dollars, analysts said. But it’s also a sign of the rough 2022 results so far, they noted.As of Wednesday, the Dow was down more than 14% year to date, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were down more than 17% and 25% respectively. As of early Wednesday afternoon, the three benchmarks were making modest rebounds.But will Tuesday’s bet pay off for average investors? Or is the purchased dip going to turn sour?Time will tell, as worries loom about a recession.But speaking of time, it’s not market timing, but the amount of time spent in the market that’s the key ingredient for long-term return on investment, financial advisers stress.\n",
